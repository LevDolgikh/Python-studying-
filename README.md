# Python-studying-
Studying Python with the book of Michael Dawson

There are a lot of mistakes, because sometimes I try to solve a problem by myself and then read how to make it right. But even if there some mistakes it still works how it should.

The studying is ended. Mostly all tasks of the book are done in this folder. Exception is the last one, which is about of creation of the game with starship and asteroids, it wasn't done because new python versions don't support livewires module and site with source files for the book is not working.
